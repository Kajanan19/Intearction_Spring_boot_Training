JavaScript

JS was designed in 1995 by Brendan Eich for Netscape. 
In 1996, Netscape submitted JS to ECMA International to be standardized, 
which lead to a new version of the language called ECMAScript.

ECMAScript 2

The first standardized version of ECMAScript was released in 1997. 
ECMAScript 2 followed a year later, bringing minor changes to modernize the language with ISO standards.

ECMAScript 3

ECMAScript 3 was released in 1999 and ushered in many new popular features, 
including expression, try/catch exception handling, and more. After ECMAScript 3, 
no changes were made to the official standard for many years.

ECMAScript 4

ECMAScript 4 was proposed as a significant upgrade in the mid-2000s. 
There was some controversy over these updates, and ES4 was scrapped.

ECMAScript 5

ECMAScript 5 (ES5) came along in 2009 with subtle changes to ES3 so that JavaScript could be supported in all browsers. 
The desire for a more robust update began around 2012 when there was a stronger push to abandon support for 
Internet Explorer.

ECMAScript 6

The next big update occurred in 2015 when ECMAScript 6 (ES6) or ECMAScript 2015 (ES2015) was officially released. 
ES6 features modernized JavaScript.

And beyond

There have been four more updates since that time: ECMAScript 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019. 
The name ES.Next is given to the upcoming version, which is still in revision and proposal
